# Green Bean Eater

This is a remake of the Commodore 64 game Montezuma's Revenge. It's a game that I'm making for my mom - she actually managed to beat the original Montezuma's Revenge, which was considered an impossible task back in the day.

The main character is different in this game. His name is Green Bean Eater and he is based off of the very first animation I ever created on a computer when I was about 7. It was a very rudimentary three-frame animation of a cartoon guy eating green beans, and I created it in Deluxe Paint IV on the Amiga 500. My mom was incredibly proud of me for starting to learn how to do such things at that age - and to this day, Green Bean Eater is one of her fondest memories. So I'm bringing him to life in a copy of her favorite notsalgic video game!

I am trying to make the game's physics feel identical to the original. By using screenshots in the C64 VICE emulator, I've figured out exactly how many pixels the character moves per frame in every situation, and I'm doing my best to make this version work exactly the same.

The game can be operated with either a keyboard or with a gamepad. The gamepad I'm using is an SNES gamepad (because the SNES is my mom's favorite console).

Be aware that the code is kind of a mess. This is the most ambitious project I've tried in Unity, and I've made a lot of progress, but I'm still learning the principles of clean code and appropriate git usage!
